#+TITLE: Weighted Optimal Tranport Integration

This python package aims to provide an easy interface for integrating
datasets using optimal transport (OT)- and Gromov-Wasserstein (GW)-based
methods. *Warning:* This package is still in an early stage. Feel free to
open an issue in case of unexpected behvior.

* Installation

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/Risitop/WOTi
pip install ./woti
#+end_src

* Examples

See three example notebooks in =examples/= directory.

* Usage

This package offers four main integration techniques, two based on
OT and two based on GW. Both OT and GW comes in two variants, balanced
(similar to SCOT technique) and unbalanced, using a quadratic program
in order to estimate reasonable weights.
