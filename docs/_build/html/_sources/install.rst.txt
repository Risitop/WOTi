Installing transmorph
=====================

There are two options for installing transmorph before using it in
your python project. Both of these options should also automatically install
all dependencies. Transmorph necessitates at least python 3.7.

    * :ref:`install_from_pypi`. You can install transmorph directly from
      PyPi repository the latest stable release (recommended).
    * :ref:`install_from_github`. You can clone the GitHub repository on your
      computer in order to benefit from the latest features. This may introduce
      instabilities, and is not recommended for new users.
